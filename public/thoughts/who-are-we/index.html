            <p>I&rsquo;m a software engineer and I tend to think like one. I see patterns, I view large real-world problems like a complex software system, and I make sense of things using tools I work with every day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one problem that keeps bothering me though: consciousness. Despite all we have learned, it is still unclear why our experience feels continuous. Why I go to sleep, wake up the next day and it is still <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>When I looked into current research I was surprised by how much progress there actually is. And at some point a thought occurred to me: maybe looking at consciousness from a software-engineering perspective isn’t that unreasonable after all.</p>
<p>This post is an attempt to think about consciousness using the tools I’m most familiar with: software engineering metaphors, system behavior, and a bit of scientific understanding.</p>
<p>Before getting into my own ideas, here is a brief overview of two recurring ideas in modern discussions about consciousness. Both will matter later:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quantum Consciousness:</strong> One popular explanation for consciousness was that quantum effects are the basis for consciousness. The theory however had major issues like that any quantum system could only last for very short times in warm and moist environments. The idea that biological systems use quantum phenomena is however not far fetched. Photosynthesis uses quantum effects for efficiency and there are more similar examples. But nothing we now know in biology comes close to suggesting that consciousness itself is a quantum process.</li>
<li><strong>Chaos and citicality:</strong> More recent scientific work found a strong correlation between consciousness and the <em>dynamic range</em> of loops in the brain. These loops are not only structural, but also do computations. They can be in a stable and predictable state or they can drift towards chaos where – not quite going into chaos though – they are highly sensitive to changes and show much more interesting behavior. This region is referred to as &ldquo;critical&rdquo;.Studies show that when people are conscious the brain operates in this critical regime. Sleep and anesthesia push the brain out of this critical region. This lines up very well with when people are conscious or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>With that theories emerge trying to explain what consciousness actually is. I want to give you my take that is based on four core ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Observer</em>: the persistent &ldquo;me&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>Consciousness</em>: an active connection between the <em>Observer</em> and the rest of the world</li>
<li><em>Simulation</em>: The process in our brain that is able to go critical</li>
<li><em>Interface</em>: A conceptual bridge that connects to the <em>Observer</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go over each one by one and start with the most important one, the <em>Observer</em>.</p>
<h3 id="we-are-like-a-singleton">We are like a Singleton</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the most important thing. Let&rsquo;s call it, him, her the <em>Observer</em>. That&rsquo;s what I would consider as &ldquo;me&rdquo;. For me it is important to distinguish between consciousness and the <em>Observer</em>. For me consciousness is the state in which the <em>Observer</em> is somehow part of the real world. Right now I&rsquo;m an <em>Observer</em> who is experiencing the world, because I&rsquo;m conscious. When I&rsquo;m sleeping I&rsquo;m unconscious, but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the <em>Observer</em> is gone. Some postulate that there is no <em>Observer</em> when I&rsquo;m unconscious, but that leads to a whole lot of questions. It doesn&rsquo;t feel to me like I&rsquo;m recreated every morning so let&rsquo;s not go with that.</p>
<p>With that we already have the first piece, because I&rsquo;m one <em>Observer</em>. I&rsquo;m somehow &ldquo;tied&rdquo; to my body, how strict that tie is and how this even works I will ignore for now. But what I say right now: each <em>Observer</em> is unique and somehow tied. I say unique to avoid any possible overlap. As software engineers we know that we get into hell if we are not strict with uniqueness. I believe that is similar in <em>Observer</em>s, they need to be unique to make sense. Each <em>Observer</em> is for me something like a Singleton instance – there is exactly one with a clear location at a specific time.</p>
<h3 id="the-interface">The Interface</h3>
<p>The next step for me is that I know things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can see</li>
<li>I can feel</li>
<li>I think</li>
<li>I interact</li>
</ul>
<p>Ignoring a lot of the nuances in these, there needs to be an <em>Interface</em> from sensory inputs to the <em>Observer</em>. Outputs of the <em>Observer</em> via the <em>Interface</em> are a bit more controversial and those touch on the <em>free will</em> debate. I simply say now that the <em>Observer</em> has some way of manipulating things via this <em>Interface</em>. We have no clue how signals in the brain turn into something specific like a color I perceive – it happens, I&rsquo;m pretty sure. But with that knowledge I have no problem also believing that there is something (yet) unexplainable going in the otherway, manipulating whatevery my body does. The important thing is that it is quite clear that there is some sort of <em>Interface</em>, it is general enough as a concept for me to accept that without knowing how.</p>
<p>Thinking about how this <em>Interface</em> looks like especially if you know interfaces from programming you might be inclined to say it might have possible &ldquo;methods&rdquo; to communicate specific types of information like visuals, audio etc. I&rsquo;m inclined to say: mostly no, because of what I call the desire to integrate, but before we go there we need to clarify one open part.</p>
<h3 id="the-simulation">The Simulation</h3>
<p>This is the important connection for me. You might have heard that the brain plays tricks on you. Your perception of the world is lagging behind, we can measure that you will decide before you do. If you remember the loops in the brain that go into a critical regime if a person is conscious, this opens up an interesting idea:
The brain is running a <em>Simulation</em> of the world to decide what to do. This <em>Simulation</em> is driven by inputs like visuals, audio etc.. This <em>Simulation</em> is in a loop and produces outputs. Now comes the interesting thing: these loops run in a critical regime when we are awake and with that give rise to consciousness. One particular feature of this critical regime is that it is very sensitive to changes.</p>
<p>I now postulate that this is exactly when the <em>Interface</em> to the <em>Observer</em> is most active and when we are conscious. The <em>Observer</em> interacts with the <em>Simulation</em> in our head, not with our body. The <em>Simulation</em> then is used in our brain to drive actions. We get a fabricated view of the world from our brain which is usually a quite good representation of the world, often even way better than what our sensors provide – like filling in the blind spot or merging our two eye sights. The <em>Observer</em> then can influence the <em>Simulation</em>, but only the parts that the brain controls via this <em>Simulation</em>. There are subconcious things that the <em>Observer</em> can not directly control like heart rate.</p>
<p>If this <em>Simulation</em> model is true, then the question becomes: what abilities come from the brain itself, and what comes from the <em>Observer</em>?</p>
<h3 id="capabilities-and-the-desire-to-integrate">Capabilities and the desire to integrate</h3>
<p>What happens with the <em>Simulation</em> hypothesis is that the capabilities are all defined by the brain and body. Your memories are part of your brain, moving limbs are capabilities your nervous system is in charge of and it does this autonomously. You don&rsquo;t fall out of the bed over night. That&rsquo;s something that simply works without any conscious input, your brain has all it needs for that. You are capable of doing this without the <em>Simulation</em> and without being conscious.</p>
<p>There are a lot of hard wired or trained things where your brain is happy to do them without involving the <em>Simulation</em>, breathing, walking – when was the last time you actively thought about each step you are taking? You can think about it, but you usually don&rsquo;t. The <em>Interface</em> is also probably not specialized for every different body part that can evolve, the brain integrates these capabilities when it gets sensory input and tries to link input and output. Maybe the <em>Observer</em> could help the brain train more effectively.</p>
<p>If you observe other animals it seems that each organism managed to integrate all limbs, muscles and what special body parts exist into their sense of self. This is a desire that the brain has. That&rsquo;s also why it can feel very natural to ride a bike. You can feel if something is wrong with it if you do it often. You can train you brain to integrate it into the <em>Simulation</em>. It works although it is not a part of you. It doesn&rsquo;t care what is truly &ldquo;yours&rdquo;. The problem with a bike is that we simply don&rsquo;t connect it directly to our brain. It is connected indirectly through other body parts. I&rsquo;m however almost confident that a brain can adapt to integrate almost anything – given that it still has enough plasticity to do so.</p>
<h3 id="evolution-could-explain-why">Evolution could explain why</h3>
<p>I heard one thing about a criticality: It is energy efficient running a system in that regime. When we evolved, skills like being able to navigate the environment with the lowest cost was cruicial. I think it is plausible that life forms that started predicting things in the world. First maybe simply the movement of enemies, later more complex patterns evolved. It is at least plausible that those predictions became more sophisticated and turned into simulations of the world. Doing this near criticality was maybe simply the most energy efficient way in the beginning. But I also believe that the <em>Observer</em> gave life forms an edge, being more capable of adapting to new things.
We see today that AI struggles a lot with anything it never saw. It is maybe even what is lacking in the quest for AGI. Maybe the necessary step towards real intelligence.</p>
<p>This is all nice and good, but evolution has a tendency to adapt things – called neofunctionalism. Is it even realistic that it found a connection to the <em>Observer</em>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-observer">What is the Observer</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m honest. I don&rsquo;t know. Research talks about the attractor state, but that one vanishes when leaving the critical regime. Maybe that is true and we are always recreated and when we go back into criticality and it is only the &ldquo;shape&rdquo; of the brains <em>Simulation</em> that defines you. I somehow doubt that a bit. It violates my idea of a Singleton Observer, could we simply recreate the same thing somewhere else and would cloning the <em>Observer</em> work? I feel this is too simple as a solution and it does not match with what everyone somehow feels. For me any theory right now would also need to somehow explain continuity, why do we at least feel it continues all our lives.</p>
<p>And with that for continuity to work, the <em>Observer</em> must be <em>non-duplicable</em>, <em>globally unique</em>, <em>identity-preserving</em>.</p>
<p>That somehow aligns quite well with what quantum states could do, or maybe it is another physical primitive. But why wouldn&rsquo;t everything in the world than be an <em>Observer</em>&hellip; Maybe everything is. They could be everywhere. I mean when you were born, there was one <em>Observer</em> available for you. A rock simply doesn&rsquo;t build an <em>Interface</em> to an <em>Observer</em>. However the <em>Simulation</em> in our head is physically working in a way that this <em>Interface</em> is sensitive enough through the criticality in the computational loop.
At least the criticality can be observed in the brain through EEG and the like. If it follows a power law and correlations span long time spans we now it is near criticality. There was an interesting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBluLfX2F_k">Veratasium video on the power law</a> recently that gives some intuition what researchers are trying to observe.</p>
<h3 id="why-im-maybe-wrong">Why I&rsquo;m maybe wrong</h3>
<p>One current hypothesis on what is consciousness states that it is the state during criticality. It has some nice features, the <em>Interface</em> is simply a &ldquo;no-op&rdquo; because the state already contains everything and evolutionary it is also part of evolving an efficient simulation in the brain. There is also no evolutionary reason why there should be one continuous <em>Observer</em>, at least I don&rsquo;t see any advantage right now if the brain contains all the information and connections. The two major things that throw me off are:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a software engineer a state does not interact, it is acted upon. It feels weird to say that the states experiences anything.</li>
<li>I prefer continuity because that fits more the experience &ldquo;we&rdquo; have.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what the future holds. I&rsquo;m already quite surprised how much progress there is in the field.</p>
