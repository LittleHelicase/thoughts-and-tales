      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer and I tend to think like one. I see patterns, I view large real-world problems like complex software systems, and I make sense of things using tools I work with every day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s one problem that keeps bothering me though: consciousness. Despite all we have learned, it is still unclear why our experience feels continuous. Why I go to sleep, wake up the next day, and it is still &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
